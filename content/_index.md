Hello World, my name is Florian Garcia Lukawski.

I am a passionate software engineer that works on various stuff going from architecture and distributed systems to infrastructure.

I am also the maintainer of the Open Source Project [Kafka Schema Registry Plugin](https://github.com/ImFlog/schema-registry-plugin).
A blog post is coming soon to explain what the project is and open source project management in general.

To reach me, follow the links above.

Happy reading !
