            <p>As tradition requires it, this post will do a tour of how this blog is built but also about the rationale behind the blog itself.
As a blog owner I cheated because this is in fact not my first post but who cares ?</p>
<p>So without further ado, let's get started !</p>
<h1 id="why">Why ?</h1>
<p>The reason is pretty simple, I always liked to share knowledge with others.
Mostly via conferences and some articles posted on my previous companies blogs.</p>
<p>But multiple factors made me reduce this activity:</p>
<ul>
<li>I changed job and I don't have the same amount of time to dedicate to this</li>
<li>I also became a dad thus I have less time out of work to prepare for such events</li>
</ul>
<p>So If I have less time, and I still want to share knowledge, what can I do ?</p>
<ul>
<li>I am not very active on social media (twitter and mastodon), I am more there to look for knowledge. 
Also, I am not very comfortable with the threads format, and I don't want to be limited by the number of characters.</li>
<li>I don't have the competency nor the time to work on video contents. I used to stream on Twitch, and may come back to this in the future,
but It's too time-consuming for me. </li>
</ul>
<p>So it leaves me with writing blog posts. Even though a lot is already available on the internet, 
I feel that writing contents for myself can help my future self and maybe others ?
After 10 years in the IT industry working in multiple domains (consulting, gambling, health startup),
I want to share tips, I want to share my experience, I want to share my knowledge and this on multiple subjects: technical and organizational ones.</p>
<p>My current company don't really have a company blog (for now) and I want to keep something for me.
My previous blog posts are still available, but It is a bit sad that I somehow never really had ownership on those.
So let's change that, and build my own blog ! I already have a lot of content In my mind that I want to share.</p>
<h1 id="how">How ?</h1>
<p>I wanted to build something simple, something that I can easily maintain and host.
That's why I decided to use a static site generator.</p>
<h2 id="static-site-generator">Static site generator</h2>
<p>A static site generator is a tool that takes a bunch of files and generate a static website out of them.
So nothing too complex on my side, I can just write content and don't have to bother about what's around it.
I preferably wanted to use a static site generator that uses markdown files, I use markdown a lot in my daily life, and I am very comfortable with it.
Like this our blog is a stateless website that serve HTML files, like in the good old days.</p>
<p>No JS ! No CSS ! No HTML ! No Database ! Just markdown files !</p>
<h3 id="zola">Zola</h3>
<p>Zola is a static site generator, it's comparable with Hugo, Jekyll, Pelican, etc...
It's based on <a href="https://commonmark.org/">CommonMark</a> a specification for Markdown.</p>
<p>One of the main reason I chose to use Zola instead of the competition is that it's an OSS project written in Rust, with an active community.
I am a Rust enthusiast, I've used the language in the past (not during my day jobs) and I really like it.
Having my site generator written in Rust will allow me to contribute to it if I need to.</p>
<p>To use Zola you only need a static binary, no need to install a runtime like NodeJS or Ruby.
Also, I am not good in all the design things (ðŸ‘‹CSS), and Zola has a lot of themes available for free.</p>
<p>This was enough to convince me.</p>
<h2 id="hosting">Hosting</h2>
<p>One of the first thing that I thought was that I am not sure how much time I will be able to dedicate to this blog.
My family is my priority and I also maintain an open source project that takes some time. I plan to feed this blog when the occasions arise.
For now, I don't want to invest money if I am not active enough here, So finding something free was one of the criteria.</p>
<h3 id="github-pages">Github pages</h3>
<p>I chose to use <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a> to host this blog.
It is a free hosting solution for static websites, it's very simple to use and has a lot of features.</p>
<p>Why did I choose GitHub pages ?</p>
<ul>
<li>I am already familiar with GitHub and it's ecosystem. That's where my OSS projects are versioned.</li>
<li>I also used GitHub actions in the past, and I am very comfortable with them.</li>
<li>It's free</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Now you know almost everything behind the technical choices I made.
Piping Zola and GitHub pages together is very simple and documented in Zola.
You can check the source code of this blog <a href="https://github.com/ImFlog/Imflog.github.io">here</a> 
and the CI/CD pipeline <a href="https://github.com/ImFlog/imflog.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml">here</a></p>
<p>Hope you will enjoy reading my future posts, and don't hesitate to comment on them !</p>
<p>Flo.</p>
